# Please keep the formatting in these commands, it is optimized to cut & paste
# into the README.md file.

## [START INSTALL.md]

# First install the development tools and libcurl.

## [START README.md]

# On Debian Stretch, libcurl links against openssl-1.0.2, and one must link
# against the same version or risk an inconsistent configuration of the library.
# This is especially important for multi-threaded applications, as openssl-1.0.2
# requires explicitly setting locking callbacks. Therefore, to use libcurl one
# must link against openssl-1.0.2. To do so, we need to install libssl1.0-dev.
# Note that this removes libssl-dev if you have it installed already, and would
# prevent you from compiling against openssl-1.1.0.

# ```bash
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y build-essential cmake git gcc g++ cmake \
        libc-ares-dev libc-ares2 libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl1.0-dev make \
        pkg-config tar wget zlib1g-dev
# ```
