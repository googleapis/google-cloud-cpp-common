## [START INSTALL.md]

# First install the development tools and OpenSSL.

## [START README.md]

# The development tools distributed with CentOS (notably CMake) are too old to
# build `google-cloud-cpp`. In these instructions, we use `cmake3` obtained from
# [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/).

RUN rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
