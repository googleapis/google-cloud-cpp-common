# Please keep the formatting in these commands, it is optimized to cut & paste
# into the README.md file.

## [START README.md]

# Install the development tools and OpenSSL. The development tools distributed
# with CentOS (notably CMake) are too old to build the
# `@GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_REPOSITORY@` project. We recommend you install cmake3 from
# [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/).

# ```bash
RUN rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
RUN yum install -y centos-release-scl
RUN yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
RUN yum makecache && \
    yum install -y automake cmake3 curl-devel gcc gcc-c++ git libtool \
        make openssl-devel pkgconfig tar wget which zlib-devel
RUN ln -sf /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake && ln -sf /usr/bin/ctest3 /usr/bin/ctest
# ```
