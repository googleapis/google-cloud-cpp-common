## [START INSTALL.md]

# First install the development tools and OpenSSL. The development tools
# distributed with CentOS 7 (notably CMake) are too old to build
# the project. In these instructions, we use `cmake3` obtained from
# [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/).

# ```bash
RUN rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
RUN yum install -y centos-release-scl
RUN yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
RUN yum makecache && \
    yum install -y automake cmake3 curl-devel gcc gcc-c++ git libtool \
        make openssl-devel pkgconfig tar wget which zlib-devel
RUN ln -sf /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake && ln -sf /usr/bin/ctest3 /usr/bin/ctest
# ```

# #### Protobuf

# We need to install a version of Protobuf, recent enough that it supports the
# Google Cloud Platform proto files:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_PROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### c-ares

# Recent versions of gRPC require c-ares >= 1.11, while CentOS-7
# distributes c-ares-1.10. Manually install a newer version:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_C_ARES_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### gRPC

# To install gRPC we first need to configure pkg-config to find the version of
# Protobuf we just installed in `/usr/local`:

# ```bash
ENV PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64
# ```

# Then we install it using using:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_GRPC_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

@BUILD_AND_TEST_PROJECT_FRAGMENT@
