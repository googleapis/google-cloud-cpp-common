## [START INSTALL.md]

# Install the minimal development tools, libcurl and OpenSSL. The gRPC Makefile
# uses `which` to determine whether the compiler is available. Install this
# command for the extremely rare case where it may be missing from your
# workstation or build server.

# ```bash
RUN zypper refresh && \
    zypper install --allow-downgrade -y automake cmake gcc gcc-c++ git gzip \
        libcurl-devel libopenssl-devel libtool make tar wget which
# ```

# #### Protobuf

# We need to install a version of Protobuf, recent enough that it supports the
# Google Cloud Platform proto files:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_PROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### c-ares

# Recent versions of gRPC require c-ares >= 1.11, while openSUSE/Leap
# distributes c-ares-1.9. Manually install a newer version:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_C_ARES_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### gRPC

# We also need a version of gRPC that is recent enough to support the Google
# Cloud Platform proto files, first configure pkg-config to find the version of
# Protobuf we just installed in `/usr/local`:

# ```bash
ENV PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64
# ```

# The we install it using using:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_GRPC_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```
