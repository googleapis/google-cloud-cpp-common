## [START INSTALL.md]

# Install the minimal development tools, OpenSSL and libcurl:

# ```bash
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y automake build-essential cmake git gcc g++ \
        libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libtool make \
        pkg-config tar wget zlib1g-dev
# ```

# #### Protobuf

# Likewise, manually install Protobuf:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_PROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### c-ares

# Recent versions of gRPC require c-ares >= 1.11, while Ubuntu-16.04
# distributes c-ares-1.10. Manually install a newer version:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_C_ARES_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### gRPC

# We also need a version of gRPC that is recent enough to support the Google
# Cloud Platform proto files. We can install gRPC from source using:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_GRPC_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

@BUILD_AND_TEST_PROJECT_FRAGMENT@
